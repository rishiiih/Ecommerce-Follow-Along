## Milestone 4: Creating User Model and Controller 🚀

In Milestone 4, we expanded our backend by introducing User Models, Controllers, and File Uploads.

✅ User Model Implementation
Defined a User Schema using Mongoose to store user details (name, email, password, etc.).
Implemented necessary validations to ensure data integrity.
Integrated bcrypt for secure password hashing. 

✅ User Controller Setup
Developed controller functions to:
Create new users
Retrieve user details
Update user information
Delete users if necessary
Handled error responses for invalid or duplicate user entries.

✅ Multer File Upload Integration
Configured Multer to handle file uploads (e.g., profile pictures).
Implemented logic to store and retrieve uploaded images.
Ensured file validation to prevent invalid file types from being uploaded.

✅ Project Submission
Pushed the updated code to GitHub.
Updated the README with Milestone 4 details.

This milestone strengthened the user management aspect of our application, making it more robust and scalable for future enhancements.

## Milestone 5: Creating the Signup Page 🚀
In Milestone 5, we focused on building the frontend Sign-Up page and implementing client-side form validation.

✅ Sign-Up Page UI Development
Created the user interface for the Sign-Up page using HTML and CSS (likely with Tailwind CSS).
Included fields for name, email, and password.
Designed the page to be user-friendly and visually appealing.

✅ Form Validation
Implemented client-side form validation to ensure data quality.
Validated email format, password strength (e.g., minimum length), and other necessary fields.
Provided user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.

✅ README Update
Documented Milestone 5 progress in this README file.

This milestone focused on creating the user registration interface and ensuring that the data entered by the user is valid before being sent to the backend. This improves user experience and reduces the load on the server.

## Milestone 6: Backend Signup Endpoint and Password Encryption 🚀
In Milestone 6, we implemented the backend endpoint to handle user signup and securely store user data, including encrypting passwords.

✅ Signup Endpoint Implementation
Created a new route and controller function to handle POST requests to the signup endpoint.
Received user data from the frontend signup form.

✅ Password Encryption
Used bcrypt to hash the user's password before storing it in the database.
Ensured that passwords are never stored in plain text.

✅ User Data Storage
Stored the complete user data (name, email, hashed password, etc.) in the MongoDB database.
Implemented error handling for duplicate entries and other potential issues.

✅ README Update
Documented Milestone 6 progress in this README file.

This milestone focused on securely handling user registration on the backend, including the crucial step of password encryption. This is essential for protecting user data and maintaining security best practices.

## Milestone 7: Backend Login Endpoint and Password Validation 🚀

✅ Login Endpoint Implementation Created a backend route to handle user login. Accepted user credentials (email/username and password) from the frontend.

✅ User Authentication Process Retrieved the corresponding user from the database using the provided email. If the user does not exist, returned an error: "User does not exist." Used bcrypt.compare to compare the entered password with the stored hashed password. If the passwords matched, authenticated the user and proceeded to login. If they did not match, returned an authentication error.

✅ Security Measures Ensured that passwords were stored as hashes using bcrypt to maintain security. Handled potential security vulnerabilities, such as brute-force attacks.

✅ README Update Documented Milestone 7 progress in this README file. This milestone introduced the backend authentication process, enabling users to log in securely by verifying their credentials against stored, encrypted passwords. This is crucial for maintaining data security and user authentication in the application.

## Milestone 8: Product Card Component and Homepage Layout 🚀

✅ Frontend Product Card Component Designed and implemented a reusable Product Card component. Utilized props to dynamically render product details like name, image, and price.

✅ Homepage Layout for Products Created a responsive homepage to display multiple Product Cards. Used Grid/Flexbox for optimal layout and user experience.

## Milestone 9: Product Input Form 🚀

✅ Product Form Implementation

Designed a form for adding product details such as name, price, and description.
Implemented an option for uploading multiple product images.
✅ Database Integration

Structured the form to send product data to the backend for storage in MongoDB.
Ensured proper validation and error handling.
✅ README Update

## Milestone 9 progress in this README file.
This milestone focused on enabling product input, which is essential for expanding the e-commerce platform by allowing users to add new products dynamically.

## Milestone 10: Product Schema and API Endpoint 🚀

✅ Product Schema Implementation Defined a Product Schema in Mongoose. Implemented validation for fields like name, price, and image URL. 

✅ API Endpoint for Adding Products Created a POST endpoint to store product details in MongoDB. Ensured proper validation before saving the data.
