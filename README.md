# Ecommerce-Follow-Along
MILESTONE-1


This is an e-commerce website that will serve as an online storefront for users to explore and purchase products easily. The platform will feature categories, filters, and a search function to help users find what they’re looking for. Each product will have a detailed page with descriptions, images, and reviews. I’ll include secure user accounts for personalized experiences and a streamlined checkout process with multiple payment options like Stripe and PayPal. The design will be mobile-responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across all devices.
