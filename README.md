## Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page

In Milestone 2, we focused on setting up the basic structure for our e-commerce application and building the first user-facing feature: the Login Page. Here's a summary of the key steps taken:

### Project Setup
1. *Folder Structure*:
   - We created a well-organized folder structure for both the frontend and backend:
     - frontend/: Contains the React application for the user interface.
     - backend/: Contains the Node.js server to handle API requests.

2. *React Frontend Setup*:
   - Initialized a React application using create-react-app to start building the user interface.
   - Installed and configured necessary dependencies for the frontend, including react-router-dom for routing.

3. *Node.js Backend Setup*:
   - Set up a simple Node.js server using Express to lay the foundation for API integration in future milestones.
   - Installed necessary dependencies like express and cors.

4. *Tailwind CSS Configuration*:
   - Integrated Tailwind CSS to streamline styling and make the design process easier with utility-first classes.
   - Configured Tailwind with PostCSS and added custom configurations for better responsiveness and custom themes.

### Login Page Development
- Built a functional and styled Login Page using React and Tailwind CSS.
- The page includes:
  - Input fields for the username and password.
  - A submit button that triggers form validation and simulates login functionality.
  - Basic styling using Tailwind CSS classes to make the page responsive and user-friendly.

### What's Next?
- In the upcoming milestones, we will:
  - Set up proper user authentication with the backend.
  - Implement features like user registration, product listing, and checkout.

### Submission
- All code changes have been committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.
- The repository is publicly accessible and includes the frontend and backend directories.
- The Login Page is functional and styled as per the requirements.
